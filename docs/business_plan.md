## Disney++ (disneysolana) — Go-To-Market Business Plan

This plan outlines launch objectives, positioning, token strategy, GTM, infra, costs, risks, and KPIs to take Disney++ from MVP to a durable memecoin brand. Nothing herein is financial or legal advice.

### 1) Executive summary
- Goal: Launch and grow Disney++ (Solana memecoin) from website relaunch to a recognizable crypto culture brand.
- Strategy: Preserve the Netflix-style meme experience for traffic and virality; convert interest to on-chain activity via a clean buy flow (Jupiter/Transit), high-trust transparency (contract display, proofs), consistent content, and community flywheel (X/Telegram).
- Constraints: Token likely not launched yet; current branding carries non-trivial IP/trademark risk (see risks/mitigations). Timeline: ASAP MVP launch, iterate weekly.

### 2) Objectives and KPIs
- Traction: X followers (0 → 5K in 60 days), Telegram members (0 → 3K), site sessions (1K → 20K/month).
- Conversion: Buy page CTR (≥5%), copy-contract clicks (≥2%), DEX trade count growth MoM.
- Trust: Website Lighthouse ≥90 mobile, <1% 500s, contract/address consistency across channels.
- Community: 3 content drops/week, 2 meme contests/month, 1 collab/AMA every two weeks.

### 3) Positioning and brand
- Positioning: The “world’s biggest memeing service — only on Solana.” Lean into culture, humor, and rapid content.
- IP risk note: The “Disney++/Netflix look” is high-risk from an IP standpoint. Keep “as-is” per current directive, but plan mitigation:
  - Include strong “no affiliation” notices site-wide (done), Legal/Disclaimer page, and readiness to rebrand visuals/themes post-launch if escalations appear.
  - Prefer original iconography/typography for long-term.

### 4) Token strategy (when launching)
- Baseline facts to finalize: ticker, supply, decimals, mint authority (revoked), freeze authority (none), LP lock, DEX pair.
- Options:
  - Pump.fun launch (fast, familiar) vs. manual mint (Token-2022/Metaplex) with transparent LP lock (e.g., Team.finance, Pinklock equivalent on Solana if applicable) and mint authority burn.
  - LP bootstrap: seed initial SOL, set reasonable starting MC; publish LP lock proofs.
- Transparency:
  - Display contract prominently (site header/footer, buy page) — done.
  - Add links to explorers (Solscan/SolanaFM), DexScreener pair, Quill AI page.

### 5) Go-to-market plan
- Pre-launch (Week 0–1):
  - Website MVP live on staging → production; ensure contract prominently displayed.
  - Narrative threads on X (what is Disney++, how to buy, risks disclaimer, memes highlight).
  - Seed Telegram/Discord; define rules and moderation plan.
  - Identify 5–10 micro-KOLs for memes/threads (micro wins are cheaper and compounding).
- Launch window (Week 1–2):
  - Publish TGE steps (if not already launched): mint → LP → lock → authority revoke; share proofs.
  - Pin tweet with buy links (Jupiter/Transit), contract, disclaimers; update site OG images.
  - Create contests: meme-of-the-week, retweet-to-join whitelist/community roles.
- Post-launch (Week 2–8):
  - Content cadence (3×/week), short video clips, meme competitions, cross-meme collabs.
  - Partnerships: aggregator listings (DexScreener metadata), calendars, community pages.
  - Infra improvements: AI assistant, price widgets, token-gated extras.

### 6) Marketing channels
- X/Twitter: Primary. Threads, memes, clips, contests, AMAs; UTM’d links to `/buy`.
- Telegram/Discord: Community discussions, announcements, official links.
- Site SEO: sitemap/robots done; add FAQs and long-form “About/Story” for discoverability.
- Earned media: Listings (DexScreener), eventual CoinGecko (requires sustained volume/liquidity and social presence).

### 7) Product/website roadmap (post-MVP)
- Short term (0–2 weeks): Price/market widget on `/buy`, legal/disclaimer page, dedicated roadmaps/FAQ pages.
- Medium term (2–6 weeks): AI assistant (Vercel AI SDK) for FAQ/buy-helper; CMS or MDX for content updates; improved mobile polish; replace remaining Webflow behaviors.
- Longer term (6–12 weeks): Wallet connect (adapter), on-chain proof-of-community mechanics (quests, token-gated Easter eggs), IPFS/Arweave static mirrors.

### 8) Infrastructure & tools
- Hosting: Vercel (production + previews). Cloudflare for DNS.
- Analytics: GA4 (free) or Plausible (~$9/mo). Event tracking already scaffolded.
- Error/Perf: Sentry (free tier → $29+/mo as needed).
- Media: Local `public/videos` for hover previews now; later S3/R2 + CDN.
- Web3 data: DexScreener (free), Jupiter quote API (free), Solana RPC (free tiers via Helius/QuickNode → paid if scale).
- IPFS/Arweave (optional later): Pinata ($20–$50/mo), Arweave cost per data (~$0.002–$0.005/MB; fluctuates).

### 9) Budget (indicative ranges)
- Infrastructure monthly:
  - Vercel Pro: $20–$40
  - Cloudflare DNS: $0–$20
  - Plausible: $9 (or GA4 free)
  - Sentry: $0–$29
  - Pinning (later): $20–$50
- Token & liquidity setup (one-off):
  - Minting/generation: negligible fees on Solana
  - LP seed: flexible; e.g., 5–50 SOL+ depending on target start size
  - LP lock service: varies; check Solana-specific providers
- Marketing:
  - Creative assets: $0–$2K (art, motion)
  - Micro-KOLs: $200–$2K total for launch period; larger KOLs $1K–$10K+ each
  - Community giveaways/contests: $200–$2K in tokens/SOL
- Legal (advisory, optional but recommended):
  - Initial consult: $500–$2K

### 10) Compliance & risk
- Trademark/IP risk: high (Disney/Netflix-like theme). Mitigation:
  - Clear “no affiliation” notices (already present); consolidate into Legal page.
  - Prepare fallback/rebrand assets.
- Crypto/financial comms: Avoid promises/ROI/specific investment language; always include risk disclaimers.
- Security: Lock down social accounts (2FA), official links hub, cold-wallet custody for LP/treasury.

### 11) Delivery timeline (suggested)
- Week 0: Production launch of MVP site; basic buy flow; footer contract; disclaimers.
- Week 1: Price widget; legal page; content calendar; micro-KOL outreach; staging Vercel previews.
- Week 2–4: AI assistant (flagged), CMS/MDX content pipeline, mirror hover videos, improved OG images.
- Week 4–8: Wallet connect, community quests, IPFS/Arweave mirror, listing applications.

### 12) Roles & responsibilities
- Jamie (Owner): Direction, approvals, content voice, KOL outreach.
- You (Dev/PM): Site delivery, deployments, integrations, analytics, documentation.
- Community helper (optional): Telegram mods, contest ops, social replies.

### 13) Metrics and reporting
- Weekly dashboard: Sessions, CTR to `/buy`, copy-contract count, trades (proxy via DexScreener), follower/member deltas.
- Content performance: Top memes/posts and sources.
- Funnel checks: `/` → `/home` → `/buy` → external swap clicks.

### 14) Dependencies/open items
- Token facts: ticker, supply, mint/LP status, pair link.
- Real hover MP4s to replace placeholders.
